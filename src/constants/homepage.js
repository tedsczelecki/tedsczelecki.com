I worked with a designer to build this clean four template site with subtle element transitions and animations. The site uses custom post types and custom form plugins to give the users a lot of customization, while still conforming to the templates.</p><p>There wasn’t anything overly challenging with this site but I had a lot of fun added in all the animations. There are elements animating in when a user scrolls down the pages and the navigation transitions out when scrolling down the page and then back in when you start scrolling up. All of this logic was written from scratch to keep the total bundle size as small as possible.</p><p>The sites is was bundled into a docker image for easy development and deployment. It was my first time deploy a Wordpress site with Docker and I highly recommend at least developing Wordpress sites this way. I have had nightmares in the past setting up a local PHP environment on WAMP and MAMP.

When I joined Konrad and Techvibes, a stock Wordpress template was in use that had many unused plugins and tons of unused code. After this rebuild, 2 plugins were in use, only code that was in use was running and a 98 on Google PageSpeed was achieved. The whole project has an editorial site, where internal and external authors are able to post; A job board, where companies have profiles and job postings; And a custom admin portal to manage the companies on the job board, manage event ticket purchases and customize job alert algorithms.</p><p>On the editorial site, there were several custom features that made it work well on all devices. The homepage has an adaptive layout. It is fully responsive but when loaded on a touch device slider functionality is improved and content is laid out slightly different to make it easier to use. Initially the homepage had ~85 database queries in order to load and render the content. This was replaced with a custom caching plugin which served static files and saw a huge boost in page load performance.</p><p>For all the sites, I worked very closely with a designer to come up and enforce styles, pixel push the design until it was perfect, and work on treatments of all the imagery. All in all, there are about 10 templates across a wordpress and a PHP site which look and work together seamlessly.</p>","info":{"date":"2018-03-01T05:00:00.000Z","categories":["html","css","javascript","wordpress","php","react"],"client":"Techvibes","company":"Konrad Group","companyUrl":"https://www.konrad.com/","projectUrl":"https://techvibes.com"},"slug":"techvibes","galleryPath":"techvibes/gallery","thumb":"/static/2619f873b047949bdcc61ce6a19dc318/1eb1b/thumb.jpg"},{"title":"Sickkids","subTitle":"Versus Limits","description":"<p>I built this landing page for a new Sick Kids campaign when I first started at Konrad Group. It was a highly interactive site that reminded me of the sites I used to build using flash. The landing page was a fully accessible and responsive so everyone would have the same experience. It was built with AngularJS and iframed into a SiteCore project.</p><p>There were several challenges in this from the handling the routing making all elements interactable using the keyboard. Out of all of the screens, the article screens had the most challenges.</p><p>On an article page there was a split screen hero image which was extremely difficult to center the focal point of the image on all screen widths and heights. To solve this we used a convention and best effort to center the focal point at all stages of the app.</p><p>Within the article itself there were embedded videos which wreaked havoc on ios mobile devices. A lot of hair pulling and hacking solved the rendering issues.</p><p>The most difficult feature that was built was making the transition between the pages as seamless and smooth as possible. The transition between an article and listing page, elements would fading in/out and animate up/down/left/right. Each animation needed an in transition and an out transition and had to be generic enough to start the animation from a state of the screens content. This took a lot of tweaking but the end result was very clean.</p><p>Sick Kids has had a large impact on me and my family so I was really cool to be able to work on this campaign.</p>","info":{"date":"2017-08-01T04:00:00.000Z","categories":["html","css","javascript","angularJS"],"client":"Sickkids","company":"Konrad Group","companyUrl":"https://www.konrad.com/"},"slug":"sickkids","galleryPath":"sickkids/gallery","thumb":"/static/52694f582aa46928fa0985e71edd2761/1eb1b/thumb.jpg"},{"title":"Catalyst","subTitle":"Web + Mobile Chat","description":"<p>From the day started working on Glovebox at Dashboard, we were always asked to embed third party chat systems onto our clients websites. In my opinion, the majority of them looked and functioned like garbage, and I always wanted to build a better version. After going to NADA (the largest dealer conference in North America), I set off to start building  a call tracking software using the Octane framework, which didn't last long. I soon pivoted to building a full-blown chat app, but with a little twist. Imagine, instead of  having to be physically on the computer to see and respond to chatting visitors on your site, you were able to forward the message to your phone via SMS and MMS. I used the Twilio api to forward messages to the dealer or the user if their cell number was in the system. I used NodeJS and Socket.io to provide the realtime chat and the Twilio NodeJS module to interact with Twilio. However, there were a few hardships along the way;  one of the most difficult to overcome, was what to build the criteria on, i.e. when or if to forward the message. There were a couple of iterations on this, but I ended up creating something elegant that solved chat forwarding and as a bonus, made everything easier to read.</p><p>I teamed up with a colleague to assist with the interface and design of the admin area and the chat that appears on a dealer's site. Everything ended up looking exceptionally crisp and it was extremely easy to use. We built it into the Octane platform to provide a seamless integration to the other products using the platform. While this never went to production, it was a great side project built from scratch by myself and completed a beta version.</p>","info":{"categories":["NodeJS","HTML/CSS","Postgres","Angular","Javascript","Octane"],"client":"Dashboard","company":"Rebel Pixel","date":"2016-03-04T05:00:00.000Z"},"slug":"catalyst","galleryPath":"catalyst/gallery","thumb":"/static/76b0c95f7cf5da264991646dacebbad2/1eb1b/thumb.jpg"},{"title":"Walmart BlackWeb","subTitle":"Find the Tone","description":"<p>I was really excited when I landed this project because I had a chance to try my hand at building a native android app, which I hadn’t built before so I had to learn quickly. This app was for  an installation promoting Walmart’s BlackWeb speakers.</p><p>A person would get into a booth and click an icon corresponding to which speaker the sounds came out of. There were two rounds in the app. The first round speakers were in the 4 corners of the booth playing tones and the second, playing music through Bluetooth headphones. In the first round there needed to be a speaker in each corner. Initially, I had 4 single channel bluetooth speakers where the app would randomize which speaker became connected. The first issue that came up, was that once a speaker connected through Bluetooth, a connecting sound would play from that speaker and there would be a small delay before playing the tone. After wasting days on trying to figure out how to turn off the connection sound, I realized I needed another idea. I ended up switching to 2 dual channel speakers, connecting one through the headphone jack and the other through Bluetooth. Since each speaker had a left and right channel I was able to mimic the sound coming out of all four corners of the room, and success! (or so I thought...)</p><p>While everything worked well the first and sometimes even the second time through, occasionally the speakers would connect to the wrong speaker and as you can probably tell this was difficult to recreate. After over 50 hours of searching Google and Stackoverflow, I finally figured out the issue was due to the newer version of the Android MediaPlayer library. Once switching back to V4, everything worked seamlessly and it was a feeling of accomplishment that I will never forget.
