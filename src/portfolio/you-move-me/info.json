  "description": "<p>This site was for the launch of the new brand You Move Me, located in both the US and Canada. This site had a lot of firsts for me which included: the first non automotive site and one that needed a blog engine on Glovebox; the first time I had used Foundation css framework; and the first time I had coded (a somewhat) responsive layout. With their business model, the need for franchises to have their own site within the corporate site was neccessary to be built into Glovebox.</p><p>I had to build a blog engine into Glovebox, which mainly included creating a taxonomy schema and all the hooks for that into Glovebox. When it came to the layout, the sidebar was the most difficult part. In the end, I used  javascript to manipulate the layout on document load (something that I cringe at the thought of, but sometimes thereâ€™s no other way).</p>",
