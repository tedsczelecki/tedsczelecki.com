  "description": "<p>The Extra Money Giveaway was a microsite developed for H&R Block as a fun giveaway of money and free tax services. This site hasn't been up for a while now, but it was one of my first full site builds I had ever done. The site was built using Flash and Papervision 3D in order to achieve the 3D floating. The most interesting part was the reflection on the cubes. Papervision has a reflection class for the cubes, but it didn't achieve the look that we were going for, so I had to write my own. In the end, I duplicated the image that was on the face of the cube on the fly, flipped it and created a gradient mask starting on the bottom and continuing upwards.</p>",
