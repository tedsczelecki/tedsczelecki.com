  "description": "<p>Filtrete was a site created for 3M to show off the efficiency of their furnace filters. This site was one of the first sites I worked on at Dashboard, and the amount I learnt from it was unbelievable. The most interesting part of the site was an awesome stereoscopic 3d adventure down a furnace grate to see all the creepy crawlers that exist. My part of the project was developing the particel system on the  individual filter pages. Different specks of `dust` would fly in from all angles and get trapped on the filters. This site won an FWA Site of the Day award, Applied Arts award and was featured in the stereoscopic edition of .Net Magazine.</p>",
