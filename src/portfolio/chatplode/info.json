  "description": "<p>Chatplode was a business venture, where the client wanted to allow a user to upload an image and chat about it for up to 24 hours. The concept was very simple, and I had to do a little design work since a Themeforest theme was provided. The difficult part was creating a production site built with NodeJS and MongoDB.</p><p>This was my first site that went into production which was built on Node and Mongo. On top of that, I had to figure out how to push a NodeJS live on a rackspace server. I ended up writing everything from scratch so that I could learn how to build a Node project from the ground up. In the end, I added a few extra features within the chat like emoticons and changing your chat color. Unfortunately, the client has since taken the site down.</p>",
