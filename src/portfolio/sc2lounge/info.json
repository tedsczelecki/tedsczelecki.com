  "description": "<p>SC2Lounge was the first personal site I have made and launched. When watching Starcraft 2 and e-sports videos on YouTube, I often became aggravated when the first video out of a series would end and the next  would not automatically start. SC2Lounge was my solution. After over a year of repeatedly coding and re-coding it, it launched.</p><p>I rewrote all of the code on this site 3 times before I was happy with how the code was written and how the site functioned. The most noticeable improvement were the benchmarks in the updating process of the database. I started off using php to load the user data from YouTube and Zend Lucene to build the search index. The performance was fine for the first time around, however, once that virgin cloud lifted I started looking for another alternative. After doing a lot of research, I decided that using Java and Apache Lucene was the best bet. The only problem was, I didnâ€™t know Java. I took the time to learn the language, which was a lot like Actionscript 3, and after writing the script that did the same thing php was doing, I couldn't have been happier with the result. There were amazing performance improvements when building the search index. I was able to get it working on the first try and I had to watch the directories to make sure it was actually working properly due to the speed. In indexing 20,000 database entries, php took ~5 minutes while java took ~9 seconds. No brainer right?!</p>",
