	"description": "<p>The Fletchers site was for their brand launch in Canada. It was a relatively simple site to show off their products, create some tasty recipes and BBQ tips for their BBQ leagues.</p><p>The site was built with Foundation and built on Glovebox, and because of that it was a nice quick build with little problems. A difficulty I did encounter was with angled text in the big daddy, where I wanted to use the `rotate` css property, so it would be able to be editable through Glovebox. In the end, I found a happy medium between font size and position.</p>",
