  "description": "<p>The Windsor Chamber of Commerce site was for a group that represents various businesses in and around the Windsor, Ontario area. It was built on wordpress, but it also integrated Membee profiles and directories.</p><p>The most difficult part of this site by far was integrating the Membee member info. It is a very old looking (and functioning) directory login utility that was extremely hard to use to just achieve simple pulls of information. Other than that, it was a very standard wordpress build  using custom post types and multiple plug-ins to end up with a very sleek and speedy site experience.</p>",
